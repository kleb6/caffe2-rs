# caffe2op-histogram

The `caffe2op-histogram` Rust crate provides an
implementation of the Histogram operator, which is
commonly used in machine learning and signal
processing applications for analyzing the
distribution of data.

## HistogramOp

The `HistogramOp` struct represents the Histogram
operator, which takes as input a tensor of data
values and outputs a tensor representing the
histogram of those values. The operator works by
dividing the range of the input data into a set of
bins and counting the number of input values that
fall within each bin.

The Histogram operator can be mathematically
represented as follows:

```
histogram(x, bins) = h
where h_i = number of elements in x that fall in bin i
```

where `x` is the input tensor, `bins` is the
number of bins to use, and `h` is the output
tensor representing the histogram.

## HistogramOpOutputs

The `HistogramOpOutputs` struct represents the
output of the Histogram operator. It contains
a single field, `histogram`, which is a tensor
representing the histogram of the input data.

The Histogram operator can be useful for
understanding the distribution of data, such as in
the case of analyzing the performance of a machine
learning model. By examining the histogram of the
model's output values, one can gain insight into
the strengths and weaknesses of the model.

Overall, the `caffe2op-histogram` crate provides
a useful tool for performing histogram analysis on
data, and can be integrated into larger machine
learning and signal processing workflows.
