## `caffe2op-crash`

A Rust crate providing a mathematical operator for
use in debugging software.

The `CrashOp` operator is defined within this
crate, and is used to intentionally crash
a program in order to identify and debug
issues. When the `CrashOp` operator is called, it
will immediately cause a program crash, providing
developers with valuable information about the
root cause of the issue.

This crate is particularly well-suited for use in
Linux environments, and is designed to be highly
performant and efficient. While the `CrashOp`
operator may seem counterintuitive, it can be an
invaluable tool for identifying and resolving
complex bugs and issues in software.

Note that this crate should be used with caution,
and only in situations where a program crash can
be safely and effectively utilized for debugging
purposes.
