## `caffe2op-orderswitch`

This Rust crate provides mathematical operators
for converting tensors between different data
layouts, specifically between the NCHW and NHWC
formats. These operators are commonly used in deep
learning and computer vision applications to
optimize the memory layout of data passed through
the neural network.

**Note: This crate is currently being translated from C++ to Rust, and some function bodies may still be in the process of translation.**

### NCHW2NHWCOp and NHWC2NCHWOp

The `NCHW2NHWCOp` and `NHWC2NCHWOp` operators
perform tensor layout transformations between the
NCHW and NHWC formats, respectively. The NCHW
format is commonly used in deep learning
frameworks such as PyTorch and Caffe, where data
is arranged in the dimensions of batch size,
number of channels, height, and width. On the
other hand, the NHWC format is used in frameworks
such as TensorFlow, where data is arranged in the
dimensions of batch size, height, width, and
number of channels. These transformations are
necessary when using models trained on one
framework in another framework or when optimizing
memory usage by changing the layout.

### CudnnNCHW2NHWCOp and CudnnNHWC2NCHWOp

The `CudnnNCHW2NHWCOp` and `CudnnNHWC2NCHWOp`
operators are similar to the above NCHW2NHWCOp and
NHWC2NCHWOp operators, but are specifically
designed to work with NVIDIA's cuDNN
library. cuDNN is a popular library for
accelerating deep learning computations on NVIDIA
GPUs, and these operators provide optimized
implementations of the tensor layout
transformations using cuDNN's built-in functions.

### GetNCHW2NHWCGradient and GetNHWC2NCHWGradient

The `GetNCHW2NHWCGradient` and
`GetNHWC2NCHWGradient` operators provide the
gradient of the NCHW2NHWCOp and NHWC2NCHWOp
operators, respectively. These gradients are
necessary for backpropagation during the training
of deep learning models.

### CudnnOrderSwithOpBase

The `CudnnOrderSwithOpBase` is a base operator for
the `CudnnNCHW2NHWCOp` and `CudnnNHWC2NCHWOp`
operators, which provides common functionality
such as setting tensor descriptors and running the
operator on a specific device.

### Other Operators and Functions

The crate also provides other operators such as
`drop`, which frees memory associated with
a tensor, and `tensor_inference_function`, which
is used to infer the output shape of an operator
given the input shape. Additionally, there are
functions such as `register_cpu_operator`,
`register_cuda_operator`, and
`register_cudnn_operator`, which are used to
register the operators with the appropriate
device-specific implementation and
`run_on_device`, which is used to run an operator
on a specific device.

Overall, the `caffe2op-orderswitch` crate provides
essential operators and functions for transforming
tensor data layouts, specifically between the NCHW
and NHWC formats, which are commonly used in deep
learning and computer vision applications.

13> could you teach me about these two formats?

Certainly!

The `.npy` format is a file format used for
storing arrays of numerical data in a binary
file. It was created to support the Python
programming language, but it can be used to store
arrays for other programming languages as
well. The format is efficient because it stores
the numerical data in a binary format, rather than
a text format. This makes it faster to read and
write large arrays of numerical data.

The `.h5` format is a file format used for storing
large amounts of numerical data. It was created to
support the Hierarchical Data Format (HDF) used in
scientific research, but it has since been adopted
for use in other fields as well. The format is
efficient because it allows for the storage of
large amounts of data in a compact manner. It also
supports the compression of data, which can reduce
the size of the file even further. The `.h5`
format can be used to store a variety of data
types, including numerical data, text data, and
images.

Both formats are commonly used in machine learning
because they allow for the storage and retrieval
of large amounts of numerical data, which is often
used as training data for machine learning
models. The choice between the two formats often
depends on the specific needs of the project, such
as the size of the data and the speed at which it
needs to be read and written.

14> thanks, but i meant nchw and nhwc

Oh, I see! `NCHW` and `NHWC` refer to two
different data layout formats used in deep
learning frameworks to represent multi-dimensional
arrays, such as images.

`NCHW` stands for "batch size, number of channels,
height, and width." In this format, the batch size
is the number of images in the input data, the
number of channels represents the number of color
channels in the image (such as red, green, and
blue), and the height and width represent the
spatial dimensions of the image. In this format,
the channel dimension comes before the spatial
dimensions, which means that the data is laid out
in memory in a way that is more efficient for some
types of hardware architectures.

`NHWC` stands for "batch size, height, width, and
number of channels." In this format, the batch
size and spatial dimensions are the same as in the
`NCHW` format, but the channel dimension comes
last. This format is often used in TensorFlow and
other frameworks because it is more compatible
with certain types of hardware, such as GPUs.

The choice between `NCHW` and `NHWC` often depends
on the specific needs of the project, including
the hardware being used, the size of the input
data, and the performance requirements of the
application.

15> i know what they are, but could you more
explicitly detail their layout? perhaps using
ascii diagrams

Sure! Here are some examples of the layouts for
`NCHW` and `NHWC`:

`NCHW`:
```
  +----------------+----------------+----------------+
  | Channel 1      | Channel 2      | ...            |
  |                |                |                |
  |   +------+     |   +------+     |   +------+     |
  |   |      |     |   |      |     |   |      |     |
  |   |      |     |   |      |     |   |      |     |
  |   +------+     |   +------+     |   +------+     |
  |     ...        |     ...        |     ...        |
  |                |                |                |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  +----------------+----------------+----------------+
```

In this layout, the first dimension represents the
batch size, followed by the channel dimension, and
then the spatial dimensions of height and
width. Each channel is represented as a 2D grid of
pixels.

`NHWC`:
```
  +--------------------------------------------------+
  | Pixel (0,0)    | Pixel (0,1)    | ...            |
  |                |                |                |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  |                |                |                |
  | Pixel (1,0)    | Pixel (1,1)    | ...            |
  |                |                |                |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | |      |       | |      |       | |      |       |
  | +------+       | +------+       | +------+       |
  |                |                |                |
  | ...            | ...            | ...            |
  +--------------------------------------------------+
```

In this layout, the first dimension is still the
batch size, followed by the spatial dimensions of
height and width, and finally the channel
dimension. Each pixel is represented as a vector
of channel values.

16> cool, thanks! why do the frameworks use
different layouts?

The choice of data layout depends on a number of
factors including hardware architecture,
computational efficiency, and data access
patterns.

Historically, convolutional neural networks (CNNs)
were first developed for image recognition tasks
using CPUs, which are optimized for sequential
access to memory. As a result, the NCHW format was
commonly used since it enables efficient
sequential reads of contiguous memory blocks.

However, as GPUs became more prevalent in deep
learning, their architecture was better suited for
parallel access to memory. This led to the
development of the NHWC format, which enables more
efficient parallel reads across different
channels.

Today, the choice of data layout can depend on the
specific hardware being used as well as the
specific neural network architecture and
task. Some frameworks and libraries may also offer
support for both NCHW and NHWC layouts to allow
for flexibility and compatibility with different
hardware and use cases.
