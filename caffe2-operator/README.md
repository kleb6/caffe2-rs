# `caffe2-operator`

A Rust crate for the Caffe2 operator library,
which is in the process of being translated from
C++ to Rust. This crate contains translations of
some of the functions from the original C++
library, but some function bodies are still in the
process of being translated.

## Core Primitives

- `AsyncSchedulingNet`: a net that supports async
  scheduling of operators

- `GradientMakerStorage`: storage for gradient
  makers

- `Observable`: a type that can be observed by an
  `Observer`

- `OperatorInfo`: metadata for operators, such as
  input/output names and types

- `OperatorRegistry`: registry for operators

- `OperatorStorage`: storage for operators

- `Tracer`: a tool for tracing and profiling the
  execution of code

- `TracerEvent`: an event generated by a `Tracer`

- `Workspace`: a workspace for storing blobs and
  nets

## Core Algorithms

- `GradientNotImplementedYet`: an algorithm for
  handling gradient operations that are not yet
  implemented

- `GradientOpsMeta`: a metadata class that helps
  in computing gradients

- `GradientWrapper`: a wrapper for computing
  gradients

- `match_grads_to_params`: an algorithm for
  matching gradients to their corresponding
  parameters

- `operator_schema_test_*`: a set of algorithms
  for testing operator schemas, including cost
  inference, tensor inference, and inplace
  enforcement

- `run_on_device`: an algorithm for running an
  operator on a specific device

- `serialize_event`: an algorithm for serializing
  `TracerEvent` objects
