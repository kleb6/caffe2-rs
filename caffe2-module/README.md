# `caffe2-module`

---

Crate in the process of being translated from C++
to Rust. Some function bodies may still be
undergoing translation.

---

`ModuleSchema`

This type represents the schema of a Caffe2
module. A module is a collection of operators and
associated state that can be run as a single
unit. The schema of a module defines the inputs
and outputs of the module, as well as any
associated parameters or attributes.

---

`current_module_handles`

`current_modules`

`g_module_change_mutex`

`has_module`

`load_module`

`mutable_current_modules`

These functions and variables are used to manage
the state of Caffe2
modules. `current_module_handles` and
`current_modules` provide access to the current
modules and their handles,
respectively. `g_module_change_mutex` is a mutex
used to synchronize access to the current module
state. `has_module` checks if a module is
currently loaded, while `load_module` loads
a module into the current module
state. `mutable_current_modules` provides
a mutable reference to the current module state,
which can be used to modify the state of the
loaded modules.

---

`Caffe2ModuleTestStaticDummyOp`

This type represents a dummy operator used for
testing Caffe2 modules. The operator does not
perform any computation and is used only to test
the loading and running of Caffe2 modules.

---

`caffe2_module`

`module_test_dynamic_module`

`module_test_static_module`

These types represent Caffe2 modules used for
testing and validation. `caffe2_module` is a macro
used to define a new Caffe2 module, while
`module_test_dynamic_module` and
`module_test_static_module` are specific modules
used for testing and validation.

---

`register_cpu_operator`

This function registers a new CPU operator with
Caffe2. An operator is a function that performs
a specific computation, such as a convolution or
a matrix multiplication. Registering a new
operator with Caffe2 allows it to be used in
Caffe2 modules and networks.

---

`run`

This function runs a Caffe2 module. Running
a module executes all the operators in the module
in the correct order, with the appropriate inputs
and parameters.

---

`typename`

This function returns the name of the type of
a given value. It is used to provide type
information for Caffe2 modules and operators.

---

In summary, `caffe2-module` is a Rust crate that
provides functions and types for managing and
running Caffe2 modules. Caffe2 modules are
collections of operators and associated state that
can be run as a single unit, and are used in deep
learning for tasks such as training and
inference. The crate provides functions for
loading and managing modules, as well as for
registering new operators with Caffe2. The crate
is still in the process of being translated from
C++ to Rust, but many of the core functions are
already available.
