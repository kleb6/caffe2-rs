# `caffe2op-selfbinning`

This crate defines the `SelfBinningHistogramOp`
operator, which is used in digital signal
processing and machine learning computations to
compute a histogram of a tensor with automatically
determined bin boundaries.

**Note: This crate is currently being translated
from C++ to Rust, and some function bodies may
still be in the process of translation.**

## Mathematical Description

Given a tensor `X` with elements `x_i`, the
`SelfBinningHistogramOp` operator computes
a histogram with automatically determined bin
boundaries. The bin boundaries are determined by
dividing the range of values in `X` into a set of
equally spaced bins, such that each bin contains
approximately the same number of
elements. Specifically, the operator performs the
following steps:

1. Compute the minimum and maximum values in `X`,
   denoted as `min_x` and `max_x`, respectively.

2. Divide the range `[min_x, max_x]` into
   `num_bins` equally spaced intervals, where
   `num_bins` is a parameter specified by the
   user. The `i`-th interval is defined as `[min_x
   + (i-1)*bin_width, min_x + i*bin_width]`, where
   `bin_width = (max_x - min_x) / num_bins`.

3. Count the number of elements in `X` that fall
   into each bin.

The resulting histogram is a tensor of shape
`(num_bins,)`, where the `i`-th element represents
the number of elements in `X` that fall into the
`i`-th bin.

## Usage

To use the `SelfBinningHistogramOp` operator, call
the `run_on_device` method, passing in a reference
to the input tensor `X`, the number of bins
`num_bins`, and a reference to an output tensor
`Y` where the histogram will be stored. For
example:

```rust
let x = arr2(&[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]);
let mut y = Array1::<i32>::zeros(3);
let op = SelfBinningHistogramOp::new();
op.run_on_device(&[&x], &mut [y.view_mut()], &[3]);
```

The above code would compute a histogram of `x`
with 3 bins and store the result in `y`.

## Implementation Details

The `SelfBinningHistogramOp` operator is currently
being translated from C++ to Rust, and some
function bodies may still be in the process of
translation. The operator is implemented using the
`OpKernel` and `OpKernelState` abstractions
provided by the Caffe2 library.

The operator does not support gradient
computation, and the `should_not_do_gradient`
method should be called to indicate that gradient
computation should not be performed.

To use the operator on a CPU device, the
`register_cpu_operator` method should be called to
register the operator with the Caffe2 CPU operator
registry.

5> so, the idea of self binning is basically to
determine the barriers between bins
automatically. is that correct? are there several
competing algorithms for doing this?

Yes, that's correct! The self-binning approach
aims to automatically determine the boundaries
between bins based on the distribution of
data. There are indeed several algorithms for
doing this, and the choice of algorithm can depend
on various factors such as the data distribution
and the desired binning resolution.

Some commonly used algorithms for self-binning
include the Sturges' rule, the Freedman-Diaconis
rule, and the Scott's rule, among others. These
algorithms differ in their assumptions about the
data distribution and in the way they determine
the bin width or bin boundaries.

For example, Sturges' rule assumes that the data
follows a normal distribution and uses a fixed
number of bins based on the sample size. The
Freedman-Diaconis rule, on the other hand, takes
into account the interquartile range of the data
and adjusts the bin width accordingly. Scott's
rule uses a bandwidth estimator based on the
standard deviation of the data. Other algorithms
may use clustering techniques or density
estimation to determine the bin boundaries.

Overall, the choice of algorithm can depend on the
specific application and the characteristics of
the data being analyzed.

6> could you please teach me these rules as well
as the corresponding algorithms? what do we do if
we don't know what the distribution is up front?

Sure, I'd be happy to explain these binning rules
and algorithms!

1. Sturges' rule: This rule assumes that the data
   follows a normal distribution and uses a fixed
   number of bins based on the sample size. The
   number of bins `k` is given by:

   k = 1 + log2(n)

   where `n` is the number of samples in the data.

2. Freedman-Diaconis rule: This rule takes into
   account the interquartile range of the data and
   adjusts the bin width accordingly. The bin
   width `h` is given by:

   h = 2 * IQR(x) / (n^(1/3))

   where `IQR(x)` is the interquartile range of
   the data `x` and `n` is the number of
   samples. The number of bins can then be
   calculated by dividing the data range by the
   bin width.

3. Scott's rule: This rule uses a bandwidth
   estimator based on the standard deviation of
   the data. The bin width `h` is given by:

   h = 3.5 * sigma / (n^(1/3))

   where `sigma` is the standard deviation of the
   data `x` and `n` is the number of samples. The
   number of bins can then be calculated by
   dividing the data range by the bin width.

If we don't know the distribution of the data up
front, we can use a more general approach such as
kernel density estimation to estimate the
underlying distribution and determine the bin
boundaries based on the estimated density. Kernel
density estimation is a non-parametric technique
that estimates the probability density function of
the data based on a kernel function and
a bandwidth parameter.

There are several algorithms for kernel density
estimation, such as the Gaussian kernel density
estimation and the Epanechnikov kernel density
estimation. These algorithms can be used to
estimate the density of the data and determine the
bin boundaries based on the estimated density.

7> could you show me how to perform kernel density
estimation?

Sure! Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is
a non-parametric way to estimate the probability
density function of a random variable. The basic
idea of KDE is to estimate the density at each
point by using a kernel function, which is
centered at that point and weighted by the data
around it.

Here is some sample code in Rust that demonstrates
how to perform KDE using the Gaussian kernel:

```rust
use ndarray::{Array1, ArrayView1, s, Array2};
use ndarray_stats::QuantileExt;

// Define the kernel function
fn gaussian_kernel(x: f64) -> f64 {
    let two_pi = std::f64::consts::PI * 2.0;
    (1.0 / (two_pi).sqrt()) * (-x.powi(2) / 2.0)
}

// Perform KDE on a 1D array of data
fn kde_1d(data: ArrayView1<f64>, bandwidth: f64, num_points: usize) -> Array2<f64> {
    let n = data.len();
    let min_x = data.min().unwrap();
    let max_x = data.max().unwrap();
    let x = Array1::linspace(min_x, max_x, num_points);
    let kde = x.map(|xi| {
        let kernel_sum = data.iter().map(|xj| {
            gaussian_kernel((xi - xj) / bandwidth)
        }).sum::<f64>();
        kernel_sum / (n as f64 * bandwidth)
    });
    Array2::from_shape_fn((num_points, 2), |(i, j)| {
        match j {
            0 => x[i],
            1 => kde[i],
            _ => unreachable!(),
        }
    })
}

fn main() {
    // Generate some sample data
    let data = Array1::random(1000, rand::distributions::Normal::new(0.0, 1.0));

    // Compute the KDE with a bandwidth of 0.1 and 1000 points
    let kde = kde_1d(&data.view(), 0.1, 1000);

    // Print the first 5 points of the KDE
    for i in 0..5 {
        println!("x = {:.2}, kde(x) = {:.2}", kde[(i, 0)], kde[(i, 1)]);
    }
}
```

This code generates a random sample of 1000 data
points from a normal distribution, and computes
the KDE using a bandwidth of 0.1 and 1000
points. The `gaussian_kernel` function is used as
the kernel function, and `kde_1d` performs the
actual KDE computation. The result is stored in
a 2D array where the first column contains the
x-values and the second column contains the
estimated density values. Finally, the first
5 points of the KDE are printed to the console.

Note that the choice of bandwidth is an important
parameter in KDE, and can have a significant
impact on the quality of the estimate. In
practice, the bandwidth is often chosen using
cross-validation or other methods to optimize some
measure of goodness-of-fit.

8> are the distributions typically normal in
neural networks? or do we see other patterns
typically emergy?

In neural networks, the distributions of the input
and output data can take various forms depending
on the nature of the problem and the data being
used. While normal distributions may be common in
some cases, other distributions can also emerge.

For example, in image classification tasks, the
pixel values of images may follow a uniform
distribution or a distribution specific to the
image dataset. In natural language processing, the
length of sentences or the frequency of words can
follow differentk distributions, such as Zipf's
law.

It is important to understand the nature of the
distribution of the data being used in neural
networks as it can affect the performance and
accuracy of the model.

1> what is zipf's law?

Zipf's law is a linguistic principle that states
that in any given corpus of natural language, the
frequency of any word is inversely proportional to
its rank in the frequency table. In other words,
the most frequently occurring word in a language
will occur roughly twice as often as the second
most frequently occurring word, three times as
often as the third most frequent word, and so on.

Zipf's law is often expressed as a mathematical
formula, where f(w) represents the frequency of
a given word, r(w) represents the rank of that
word in the frequency table, and k is a constant
that depends on the language being analyzed:

f(w) = k / r(w)

Zipf's law has been observed to hold across a wide
variety of languages, including English, Spanish,
Chinese, and many others. It has also been
observed to apply to other types of data, such as
the distribution of city sizes or the popularity
of websites.
