caffe2op-accuracy is a Rust crate that defines an
operator used for evaluating the accuracy of
machine learning models. This operator computes
the accuracy score of the predictions made by
a model given a set of true labels.

**Note: This crate is currently being translated from C++ to Rust, and some function bodies may still be in the process of translation.**

This crate compares the predicted values with the
true label data and to compute an accuracy score
based on this comparison. Specifically, it uses
the argmax function to identify the predicted
label for each input, and compares it with the
true label data to compute a score.

The crate also includes other symbols related to
managing the inputs and outputs of the operator,
such as slots and scoring.
