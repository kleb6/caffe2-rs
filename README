# caffe2-rs

Greetings!

This project is the foundation of an operator network library for the rust ecosystem.

There is still a long way to go, but as you can see, the basis is forming.

Essentially, what we need to do is finish translating the implementations of each operator and the supporting crates.  

The interfaces are roughly in place. 

While much of the code is in need of some polish, the translation task is now parallelized.

-----------------------

The goals here are high performance, high modularity, and ease of integration into all future systems written in rust.  

I have included the unit tests from the c++ codebase so that we can verify functionality.  

Hopefully, in the near future, this library can serve as a reference model for pytorch, as well as a tool for the rust ecosystem.

The DNA here is from the flexible and robust caffe2 c++ library.  

I learned quite a bit during this process of translation, and am deeply thankful to the original authors, without whom this work would not exist.


I'd also like to mention the people without whom I would not be able to read, write, and work in these languages.  
I consider them my heroes and first mentors, and hope that we will get to work together again one day.   

Bob, Jeff, Hua, and many others -- thank you.


As for caffe2* rust, all credit to the original caffe* and torch programmers.

Best,
