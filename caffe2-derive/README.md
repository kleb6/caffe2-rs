## caffe2-derive

A Rust proc macro crate for automatically deriving
operator implementations in the caffe2 workspace.

This crate provides a set of proc macros for the
caffe2 rust workspace. 

Note that this crate is still in the process of
being translated from C++ to Rust, and so some of
the function bodies may still be in the process of
translation.
