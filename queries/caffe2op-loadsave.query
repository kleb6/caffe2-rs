hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-loadsave. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
BlobState
build_blob_name_from_db_key
prepare_blob
process_blob
update_blob_states
validate_blob_states
CheckpointOp
DBExistsOp
LoadOp
SaveOp
db_exists_op_example
extract
extract_all
extract_from
format_string
get_blob_options
int
load_op_example
load_tensor_inference
no_gradient
of
register_cpu_operator
register_cuda_operator
run_on_device
save_op_example
set_current_device
should_not_do_gradient
tensor_inference_function
