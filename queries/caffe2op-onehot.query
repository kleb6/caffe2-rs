hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-onehot. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Please indicate that the crate is in the
process of being translated from C++ to
Rust. It is possible some of the function
bodies are in the process of translation.

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
int64_t
run_on_device
SegmentOneHotOp
run_on_device
no_gradient
register_cpu_operator
do_one_hot_op
BatchOneHotOp
cost_inference_function
run_on_device
tensor_inference_function
do_run_with_type
BatchBucketOneHotOp
tensor_inference_function
OneHotOp
OpSchema
cost_inference_for_batch_one_hot
tensor_inference_for_batch_one_hot
tensor_inference_for_bucket_batch_one_hot
run_on_device
one_hot_op_example
