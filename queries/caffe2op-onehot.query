hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-onehot. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
BatchBucketOneHotOp
BatchOneHotOp
OneHotOp
OpSchema
SegmentOneHotOp
cost_inference_for_batch_one_hot
cost_inference_function
do_one_hot_op
do_run_with_type
int64_t
no_gradient
one_hot_op_example
register_cpu_operator
run_on_device
tensor_inference_for_batch_one_hot
tensor_inference_for_bucket_batch_one_hot
tensor_inference_function
