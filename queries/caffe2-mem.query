hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2-mem. 

It is part of workspace containing the rust
translation of the caffe2 operator library.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the following format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Please indicate that the crate is in the
process of being translated from C++ to
Rust. It is possible some of the function
bodies are in the process of translation.

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
ComputeBlobRecyclingForDag
apply_assignments
apply_asyncif_blob_assignments
apply_recurrent_blob_assignments
can_use_blob
compute_blob_recycling_for_dag
get_blob_or_mapped_blob
get_free_blob
has_key_in_map
has_key_in_set
infer_blob_size
optimize_inference_net
optimize_net
process_op
run_schema_check
