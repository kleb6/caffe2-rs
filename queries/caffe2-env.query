hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2-env. 

It is part of workspace containing the rust
translation of the caffe2 operator library.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the following format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Please indicate that the crate is in the
process of being translated from C++ to
Rust. It is possible some of the function
bodies are in the process of translation.

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
caffe_register_device_type
declare_bool
declare_double
declare_export_caffe2_op_to_c10
declare_int
declare_int32
declare_registry
declare_string
declare_typed_registry
define_bool
define_int
define_int64

export_c10_op_to_caffe2_cpu
export_caffe2_op_to_c10_cpu
