hello! could you please help me write a crate-description for the rust crate "caffe2-init" containing the following symbols? not all of the symbols are defined in this crate, but they are used somehow (please do not explicitly list the symbols, or write anything other than a simple description.  no description header is necessary. however, please be descriptive without making too many assumptions. also, if there are any mathematical ideas you identify in these symbols, would you please describe them?? thanks!):
