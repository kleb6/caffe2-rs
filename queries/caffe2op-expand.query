hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-expand. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
ExpandDimsOp
GetExpandDimsGradient
GetSqueezeGradient
SqueezeOp
allow_inplace
compute_dims
expand_dims_op_example
get_gradient_defs
inherit_onnx_schema
register_cpu_operator
register_cuda_operator
register_gradient
run_on_device
squeeze_op_example
tensor_inference_function
ExpandGradientOp
ExpandOp
GetExpandGradient
do_run_with_type
get_gradient_defs
register_cpu_operator
register_cuda_operator
register_gradient
run_on_device
