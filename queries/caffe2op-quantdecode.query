hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-quantdecode. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
GetQuantDecodeGradient
QuantDecodeGradientOp
QuantDecodeOp
QuantDecodeRunTy
decode
decode_general
get_gradient_defs
quant_decode_gradient_op_example
register_cpu_gradient_operator
register_cpu_operator
register_gradient
run_on_device
