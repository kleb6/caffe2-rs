hello! 

I am writing a rust crate called caffe2op-asyncnet. 

It defines a mathematical operator used in DSP
and machine learning computations.

I would like you to help me write a rust crate
description for it.

Please write the description in the followin format:

<short description tag used in the crate header>
<double newline>
<longer, in depth description and mathematical analysis>
<END>

Below are listed some tokens from this crate. 

Please describe the mathematical ideas
identified by this information alongside the
relevant mathematical equations in unicode.

thanks!

please format your response in the Markdown file format.

here are the tokens:
AsyncBarrierOp
AsyncNetBarrierOp
allow_one_to_one_inplace
async_barrier_op_dev_infer
device_inference_function
identical_type_and_shape
register_cpu_operator
run_on_device
should_not_do_gradient
