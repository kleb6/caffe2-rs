The `caffe2op-alias` crate seems to include an
operator called `AliasOp`, which likely performs
some form of aliasing operation. Aliasing is
a phenomenon that occurs in signal processing when
different signals share the same representation in
memory. This can result in errors or distortions
in the signals when they are processed, especially
in the context of downsampling or upsampling
operations.
