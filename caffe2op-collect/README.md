# Caffe2op-Collect: Rust Crate for DSP and Machine Learning Computations

Caffe2op-Collect is a Rust crate that provides
mathematical operators for Digital Signal
Processing (DSP) and Machine Learning
computations. The crate includes the Collect
operator, which can be used for collecting and
processing data. The CollectRpnProposalsOp and the
CollectFpnProposalsOp are other operators in the
crate that can be used for detecting and modeling
objects.

**Note: This crate is currently being translated from C++ to Rust, and some function bodies may still be in the process of translation.**

The crate includes various tokens such as ArgSort,
BoxesArea, FPN, RoI, RoIs, RPN, and TOP, which are
used for different mathematical computations. The
crate also includes operators such as Distribute,
which can be used for distributing data across
different levels, and Permutation, which can be
used for manipulating data. The crate includes the
NMS (Non-Maximum Suppression) operator, which can
be used for filtering and retaining the most
appropriate proposals based on their objectness
probabilities.

The crate also provides functions for manipulating
arrays, such as sorting arrays with Argsort and
concatenating arrays with Concatenation. The crate
includes functions for reshaping arrays, such as
ConservativeResize and Squeeze. The crate also
provides functions for limiting and truncating
arrays, such as SortAndLimitRoIsByScores and Top.

Overall, Caffe2op-Collect is a powerful Rust crate
that provides a wide range of mathematical
operators and functions for DSP and Machine
Learning computations. It is built to be efficient
and reliable, and is suitable for both research
and production use.

Sure, here is a more detailed explanation of the
mathematical concepts related to the
`caffe2op-collect` crate:

## Mathematical Analysis

### ArgSort

`ArgSort` is a mathematical operation that returns
the indices that would sort an array in ascending
order. Given an array `a`, `ArgSort` returns a new
array `indices` such that `a[indices[0]]` is the
smallest element in `a`, `a[indices[1]]` is the
second smallest, and so on. `ArgSort` is commonly
used in machine learning algorithms for sorting
data based on some criterion.

### BoxesArea

`BoxesArea` is a mathematical operation that
computes the area of a set of rectangular boxes in
a two-dimensional space. Given a set of boxes `b`,
`BoxesArea` returns a new array `areas` such that
`areas[i]` is the area of the box `b[i]`. The area
of a box `b` is computed as `width * height`,
where `width` and `height` are the width and
height of the box, respectively.

### FPN

`FPN` (Feature Pyramid Network) is a concept in
computer vision that involves building a feature
pyramid by constructing a bottom-up pathway and
a top-down pathway. The bottom-up pathway is used
to extract feature maps from the input image at
different scales, while the top-down pathway is
used to build a feature pyramid by upsampling the
feature maps from the bottom-up pathway and
combining them with feature maps from higher
scales.

### NMS

`NMS` (Non-Maximum Suppression) is a technique
used in object detection to suppress multiple
overlapping detections of the same object. Given
a set of object detections, `NMS` selects the
detection with the highest confidence score and
suppresses all other detections that have
a significant overlap with the selected detection.

### RCNN

`RCNN` (Region-based Convolutional Neural Network)
is a class of neural network models used for
object detection and image segmentation. `RCNN`
models use a combination of region proposal
algorithms and convolutional neural networks to
detect objects in an image.

### RoI

`RoI` (Region of Interest) is a concept used in
object detection and image segmentation. A `RoI`
is a rectangular region in an image that is likely
to contain an object of interest. `RoIs` are
usually obtained by running a region proposal
algorithm on the input image.

### RPN

`RPN` (Region Proposal Network) is a type of
neural network used for object detection. `RPN`
generates a set of object proposals by sliding
a small network over the convolutional feature map
output by a convolutional neural network.

### TOP

`TOP` is a mathematical operation that returns the
top `n` elements of an array, sorted in descending
order. Given an array `a` and an integer `n`,
`TOP` returns a new array `top_n` that contains
the `n` largest elements of `a`, sorted in
descending order. `TOP` is commonly used in
machine learning algorithms for selecting the most
important features or instances.

These mathematical concepts are all related to
various operations performed in the
`caffe2op-collect` crate, and understanding them
is crucial for using the crate effectively in DSP
and machine learning computations.
