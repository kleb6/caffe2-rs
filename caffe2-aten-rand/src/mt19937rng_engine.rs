 | Note [Mt19937 Engine implementation]
 | ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 | Originally implemented in:
 | http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/MT2002/CODES/MTARCOK/mt19937ar-cok.c
 | and modified with C++ constructs. Moreover the state array of the engine
 | has been modified to hold 32 bit uints instead of 64 bits.
 |
 | Note that we reimplemented mt19937 instead of using mt19937 because,
 | mt19937 turns out to be faster in the pytorch codebase. PyTorch builds with -O2
 | by default and following are the benchmark numbers (benchmark code can be found at
 | https://github.com/syed-ahmed/benchmark-rngs):
 |
 | with -O2
 | Time to get 100000000 philox randoms with uniform_real_distribution = 0.462759s
 | Time to get 100000000 mt19937 randoms with uniform_real_distribution = 0.39628s
 | Time to get 100000000 mt19937 randoms with uniform_real_distribution = 0.352087s
 | Time to get 100000000 mt19937 randoms with uniform_real_distribution = 0.419454s
 |
 | mt19937 is faster when used in conjunction with uniform_real_distribution,
 | however we can't use uniform_real_distribution because of this bug:
 | http://open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG21/docs/lwg-active.html#2524. Plus, even if we used
 | uniform_real_distribution and filtered out the 1's, it is a different algorithm
 | than what's in pytorch currently and that messes up the tests in tests_distributions.py.
 | The other option, using mt19937 with uniform_real_distribution is a tad bit slower
 | than mt19937 with uniform_real_distribution and hence, we went with the latter.

 | A C-program for MT19937, with initialization improved 2002/2/10.
 | Coded by Takuji Nishimura and Makoto Matsumoto.
 | This is a faster version by taking Shawn Cokus's optimization,
 | Matthe Bellew's simplification, Isaku Wada's real version.
 |
 | Before using, initialize the state by using init_genrand(seed)
 | or init_by_array(init_key, key_length).
