# Caffe2-rs

Caffe2-rs is a Rust crate that provides an
operator network library for the Rust
ecosystem. The library is based on the flexible
and robust Caffe2 C++ library and aims to provide
high performance, high modularity, and ease of
integration into all future systems written in
Rust.

The goal of this project is to finish translating
the implementations of each operator and
supporting crates. Although much of the code is
still in need of polish, the interfaces are
roughly in place. The translation task is now
parallelized. To ensure functionality, the unit
tests from the C++ codebase have been included.

In the near future, this library could possibly serve as
a reference model for PyTorch, as well as a tool
for the Rust ecosystem. The project owes its DNA
to the original authors of the Caffe2 C++ library,
without whom this work would not exist.
